# Welcome to Coje! 👋

Hello there! Welcome to our GitHub Organization. 

We're just getting started here, so our shelves are a bit empty at the moment. But don't worry, we have some exciting projects brewing! 🚀

## What's Coming Up 🌟

- **Coje Engine**: Get coding apps, game and tools with the Coje Engine. A ground up engine build written in C++ using CMake
- **Axios Today**: Our first game made with the Coje Engine, an open world massively multiplayer sandbox (OWMMS)!
- **Boosted Web**: A variety of web protocol and language implementations aiming to become a fully fledged 3D web experience
- **Coje Link**: Gamer-programmer-centric web services
